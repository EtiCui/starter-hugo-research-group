abstract = "N -Mesyloxycarbamates undergo intramolecular C–H amination reactions to afford oxazolidinones in good to excellent yields in the presence of rhodium( ii ) carboxylate catalysts.  ,   N -Mesyloxycarbamates undergo intramolecular C–H amination reactions to afford oxazolidinones in good to excellent yields in the presence of rhodium( ii ) carboxylate catalysts. The reaction is performed under green conditions and potassium carbonate is used, forming biodegradable potassium mesylate as a reaction by-product. This method enables the production of electron-rich, electron-deficient, aromatic and heteroaromatic oxazolidinones in good to excellent yields. Conformationally restricted cyclic secondary N -mesyloxycarbamates furnish cis -oxazolidinones in high yields and selectivity; DFT calculations are provided to account for the observed selectivity. trans -Oxazolidinones were prepared from acyclic secondary N -mesyloxycarbamates using Rh 2 (oct) 4 . The selectivity was reverted with a cytoxazone N -mesyloxycarbamate precursor using large chiral rhodium( ii ) carboxylate complexes, affording the corresponding cis -oxazolidinone. This orthogonal selectivity was used to achieve the formal synthesis of (−)-cytoxazone."
