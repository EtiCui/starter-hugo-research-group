N
-Mesyloxycarbamates undergo intramolecular C–H amination reactions to afford oxazolidinones in good to excellent yields in the presence of rhodium(
ii
) carboxylate catalysts. The reaction is performed under green conditions and potassium carbonate is used, forming biodegradable potassium mesylate as a reaction by-product. This method enables the production of electron-rich, electron-deficient, aromatic and heteroaromatic oxazolidinones in good to excellent yields. Conformationally restricted cyclic secondary
N
-mesyloxycarbamates furnish
cis
-oxazolidinones in high yields and selectivity; DFT calculations are provided to account for the observed selectivity.
trans
-Oxazolidinones were prepared from acyclic secondary
N
-mesyloxycarbamates using Rh
2
(oct)
4
. The selectivity was reverted with a cytoxazone
N
-mesyloxycarbamate precursor using large chiral rhodium(
ii
) carboxylate complexes, affording the corresponding
cis
-oxazolidinone. This orthogonal selectivity was used to achieve the formal synthesis of (−)-cytoxazone.},
